## Day 1 - JavaScript Land.

I have been meaning to do a series of blog posts on full-stack JavaScript development for some time. In some ways I hate myself for contributing to the enormous landmass that is 'JavaScript development opinion' but I happen to think mine is good - mainly because I spend so much time assimilating others. As such, this isn't my opinion outright, it's my opinion on the best opinions out there.

So we are going to start today on what JavaScript is, roughly where it comes from (though I am no historian), why it matters, and why I personally think it is a safe place for a programmer to invest his precious time. Let's start with a hastily cut and pasted Wikipedia quote:

> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.

And allow me to break a bit of this down. When it talks about **high-level** it means JavaScript uses human readable words to describe the actions or logic that the code represents - a **low-level** language would be something a machine understands, like 1's and 0's. The reason JavaScript is **dynamic** and **interpreted** is because it isn't compiled - where compiled languages are all checked up-front and supplied by the developer packaged up and ready to run on a users type of machine - it instead is run through a program (the interpreter) whenever the user wants to run the code. A good analogy is flat-pack furniture vs pre-assembled furniture. Pre-assembled is already compiled, specific to the needs of the end user (they need a table), it is delivered and they can use it. Flat-pack requires the end user to have an interpreter (which makes even more sense when most IKEA names are Swedish) to take the raw materials and build as instructed. Incidentally not all interpreters work the same, and this is especially prevalant in JavaScript as the interpreter is usually inside a web-browser, of which there are many. Finally an **untyped** language means that the programming language represents everything inside it as kind of the same thing. This is actually important in interpreted languages because there is no compile process, which is where **typed** languages are checked. If you call something an Apple in JavaScript but at some other point make it equal to an Orange JavaScript won't care, but something like C# would tell you off at compile. The last point about standardization is also important - remember JavaScript is interpreted - so it is vital that everyone who creates and everyone who interprets JavaScript is roughly on the same page (I say 'roughly' with intent!).

### So What Is It

At it's heart, JavaScript is the third major component of the World Wide Web as we know it. The other two being HTML, which is a websites architecture, foundations and structure, and CSS, which is the styles, fittings and furnishings of the website. JavaScript sits on top and provides a way of interacting with a user and the webpage itself, adding anything dynamic on top - in our house analogy it is the lighting, plumbing, electrics and secret revolving doors.

First released as part of Netscape (the original web browser) it was only named JavaScript to attach on to the significant cachet of 'Java' (the two have zero in common), and was described as 'digital glue' by it's creators. From that it has grown into a fairly mature and robust language, which most developers will have had some experience of, and it's these factors - how it was never supposed to be a real language, how it evolves constantly and is used in an increasing list of systems, and how everyone kinda knows it. That makes JavaScript interesting, accessible, quick to learn and impossible to master fully - hence the vast mix of differing opinion and options.

### Gambling Aware

As developers we are all aware that there is more out there than we can possibly hope to ever understand, let alone make a career out of, and new stuff is springing up everyday. So each of us looks to a specialism, or at least a specific area of software development, that we can call our home. Typically this manifests in learning a specific language, design methodology, technology stack or combination of all of these things - and it's ultimately a gamble. It is of course possible to change at any time, and I am a firm believer of transferable skills in programming, but the right choices can ultimately give you the edge over others. JavaScript offers so much right now, and it's really still quite early on in it's rebirth as a serious contender as a programming language. Things like NodeJS and the ever increasing number of single page, or clientside, libraries that are pushing web technology to new levels of sophistication will always be in demand - not to mention the fact it'll be around forever because it's so embedded in everyone's digital life. Over the coming posts we'll cover a whole set of technologies and programming practices that should put you in great stead to round you off as a 'full-stack' JavaScript developer.
